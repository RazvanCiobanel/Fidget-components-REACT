# Fidget Components


1. We need something to urround our fidgets.
    - There is grid in the middle of the page outstanding from the background
    - The grid has 2 tiles

2. We want 5 buttons having interactions with the mouse. Create 5 buttons, one of them having the text `Click me!`, the others have the text `Loser`. When we click to the button with the text `Click me!`, the text changes between the buttons randomly. The `click me!` text gets to a random button out of the 5 buttons and the others text become `Loser`
    - There are 5 buttons in the first tile of the grid
    - One of the buttons has the `Click me!` text, the others have the `Loser` text
    - When we hover over one of the button, it scales bigger and scales back when the mouse leaves its place
    - When we click on the button with the text `Click me!`, the buttons change text
    - When we click on the button with the text `Loser`, nothing happens

3. Create a counter we can raise or decrease its number.
    - There is a number, a `+` sign and a `-` sign in the second tile of the grid
    - The default number is 0
    - When we click on the `+` sign the number grows and decrease if the `-` sign is clicked

4. [OPTIONAL] Create the components with the aid of styled-components.
    - All the components are made by styled-components
